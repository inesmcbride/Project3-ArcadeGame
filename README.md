## Instructions

Clone or download the code, and open the index.html file to run the Frogger arcade game.

## How to play

Use the arrow keys to move your player to the water! Be sure not to run in to any enemies or you will loose one life and your palyer will restart at the bottom. You only have 5 lives to win the game. Good luck!
